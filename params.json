Now is your chance to build better maps for wikipedia! Join fellow Rice mapmakers, members of the Fondren GIS/Data Center and volunteers from around the world for the first ever ever [MapLift](http://nacis.org/maplift/), organized by the [FixWikiMaps Project](http://fixwikimaps.tumblr.com) and [North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS)](http://nacis.org). Teams will be putting their map making skills to work to upgrade and create new maps for the global free encyclopedia we all rely on daily.\r\n\r\nWe are meeting at 12:15 Tuesday, September 1st, at the Fondren Library to pick our maps and go over the guidelines for building a better map. There will be a FREE lunch and much talk of cartography! At the first meeting, we will also find some times later in the week for mapmakers to meet back up, share their progress, get input and help with their maps. On September 4th, there will be a show-and-tell via twitter of the entire MapLift project.\r\n\r\nKick off the year by meeting your fellow map making enthusiasts, sharpening your cartographics skills, and contributing a little piece to our greater understanding of the world.  Celebrate International Map Year with us!\r\n\r\n**Where:** [Fondren Library | Digital Media Commons Multipurpose Room (B42F) in the basement](http://library.rice.edu/dmc)**\r\n\r\n**When:** Tuesday, September 1st, 12:15 - 1:45 pm (light lunch 12:15-12:45)\r\n\r\n**Who:** All mapmakers!\r\n\r\nWant to participate but canâ€™t make the first meeting?
